  A graphical editor to view and create USF models
---

SafetyModeler is a graphical editor to view and create USF models provided as an Eclipse plugin. It allows to create functional block models with data and control flows, definition of data types as well as safety measures to secure the functional model.

## Views in SafetyModeler

The editor consists of several views showing different aspects of a USF model. Most views can be accessed from the editorâ€™s *dashboard*. The *Block Diagrams* and *Type Diagrams* show graphical aspects of the USF model. The *Properties* view and *Stereotype and Parameters* view show non-graphical properties of model elements.

The *Block Diagram* view and *Type Diagram* view share a similar setup. On the left side is a big canvas located, where model elements are displayed as boxes and connections. This diagram area offers on the top a toolbar with some tools for the visualization of the diagram, such as zoom and layout tools. On the right side there is a palette of tools. Those tools can be used to create new model elements (e.g. blocks, ports or connections). Tools are organized by categories for a better overview.
